### :woman_technologist: About Me :
Hi, I’m Shirley.
A professional problem solver who is dedicated, challenge oriented and resourceful to make results happen. I connect with people easily and like to listen to people’s problems and offer advice and solutions. I’m a Founder who leads with empathy, resourcefulness and dedication to make results happen. My MO is being an avid communicator in both the technical and non-technical realm of cyber security.

I started my cyber security journey in 2021 on the forefront before the industry boom in Australia. Thanks to the US connections from Cybrary and Grant Collins' Cyber Academy and my studies at Melbourne Institute of TAFE in cyber security and networking. 

I was inspired to move from project management to the cyber security field where I'm constantly challenged to grow and evolve on a daily basis.
