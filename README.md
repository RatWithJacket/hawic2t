### :woman_technologist: About Me :
Hi, I’m Shirley.
A professional problem solver who is dedicated, challenge oriented and resourceful to make results happen. 
I connect with people easily and like to listen to people’s problems and offer advice and solutions. 
I’m a Founder who leads with empathy, resourcefulness and dedication to make results happen. Avid communicator in both technical and non-technical realm of cyber security.

I started my cyber security journey in 2021 on the forefront before the industry boom in Australia. Thanks to US connections of Cybrary and Grant Collins - Cyber Academy and Melbourne Institute of TAFE, I had the background knowledge to move from project management into an ICT role for cyber security awareness, auditing and incident response.
